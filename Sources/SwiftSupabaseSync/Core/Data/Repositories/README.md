# Repositories

Concrete implementations of repository protocols that coordinate between local and remote data sources. These repositories implement the business logic for data access patterns and caching strategies.

Files include AuthRepository (user authentication data), SyncRepository (synchronization state management), and SubscriptionRepository (subscription status and validation).
