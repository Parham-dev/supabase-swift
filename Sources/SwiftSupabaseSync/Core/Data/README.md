# Data Layer

This layer implements the repository pattern and manages data access from both local and remote sources. It serves as the bridge between the domain layer and external data sources, handling data transformation and persistence.

The Data layer encapsulates all data-related operations, including caching strategies, data mapping between different representations, and coordination between local and remote data sources.
