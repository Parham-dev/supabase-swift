# Publishers

Reactive Combine publishers that expose domain state changes to the UI layer. These publishers provide a declarative way for views to respond to state changes across the application.

Files include AuthStatePublisher (user authentication changes), SyncStatusPublisher (synchronization progress updates), and SubscriptionStatusPublisher (pro subscription state changes).
