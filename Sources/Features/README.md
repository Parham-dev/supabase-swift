# Features

Feature-based organization following Clean Architecture principles. Each feature is self-contained with its own domain, data, and presentation layers, promoting modularity and maintainability.

Features include Authentication (user auth and session management), Synchronization (bidirectional sync engine), Schema (model registration and table generation), and Subscription (pro feature validation).
