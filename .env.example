# Supabase Configuration - Example
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials

# Your Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co

# Your Supabase anonymous key (public key)
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# Note: The anon key is safe to expose publicly as it only allows 
# row-level security controlled access. However, it's still best 
# practice to keep it in environment variables.
