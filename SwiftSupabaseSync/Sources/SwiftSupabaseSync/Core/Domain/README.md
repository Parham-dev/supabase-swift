# Domain Layer

This layer contains the core business logic and entities of the SwiftSupabaseSync package. It defines the fundamental concepts and rules that govern synchronization between local SwiftData models and remote Supabase data.

The Domain layer is completely independent of external frameworks and implementation details, ensuring that business logic remains pure and testable. It serves as the foundation upon which all other layers build.
