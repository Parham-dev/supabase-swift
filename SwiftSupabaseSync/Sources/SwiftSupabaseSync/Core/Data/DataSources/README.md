# Data Sources

Contains implementations for accessing data from various sources, both local and remote. Data sources provide a clean abstraction layer for different storage mechanisms and external APIs.

Organized into Remote (Supabase API integrations) and Local (device storage implementations) subdirectories to clearly separate concerns and enable independent testing and configuration.
