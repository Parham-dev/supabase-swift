# Data Models

Contains data transfer objects (DTOs) and mapping logic for converting between different data representations. This separation ensures clean boundaries between external API formats and internal domain models.

Organized into DTOs (external data formats) and Mappers (conversion logic) to maintain clear separation of concerns and enable easy testing of data transformation logic.
