# Data Mappers

Contains logic for converting between DTOs and domain entities. Mappers encapsulate the transformation rules and ensure that data conversion is consistent and testable.

Files include UserMapper (converts between SupabaseUserDTO and User entity) and SyncDataMapper (handles synchronization data transformations between external and internal formats).
