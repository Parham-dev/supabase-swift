**✅ 2.3 Use Cases (Week 2-3)** - **COMPLETED**
```swift
// Business logic orchestration
✅ AuthenticateUserUseCase.swift: Login/logout workflows

```

**Key Accomplishments**:
- [x] **AuthenticateUserUseCase**: Complete auth workflows (sign in, sign up, sign out, token refresh)
- [x] **StartSyncUseCase**: Full/incremental/record sync with eligibility checking
- [x] **ValidateSubscriptionUseCase**: Feature access control with intelligent caching
- [x] **ResolveSyncConflictUseCase**: Auto/manual conflict resolution with history tracking
- [x] **Thread-Safe State Management**: Actor-based managers for concurrency
- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and recovery strategies
- [x] **Clean Compilation**: All compilation errors resolved, package builds successfully

**Technical Highlights**:
- Actor-based state managers (ResolutionHistoryManager, SyncOperationManager, ValidationCacheManager)
- Protocol-driven design with dependency injection
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Framework-independent business logic
- Memory-efficient caching strategies

#### 🔧 Step 3: Infrastructure & Data Sources Setup
**Status: PENDING** ⏳

**Objective**: Build the technical foundation for network, storage, and external service integration

**Detailed Implementation Plan**:
