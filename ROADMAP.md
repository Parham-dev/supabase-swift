# SwiftSupabaseSync Development Roadmap

A 10-step development plan to build a production-ready Swift package for synchronizing SwiftData models with Supabase databases.

## üéØ Vision

Create a seamless, offline-first synchronization solution that enables iOS/macOS developers to effortlessly sync their SwiftData models with Supabase databases while maintaining data consistency, handling conflicts intelligently, and providing enterprise-grade reliability.

## üìã Development Process Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-3) - Detailed Implementation

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Project Structure & Architecture Setup
**Status: COMPLETED** ‚ú®

**Objective**: Establish Clean Architecture foundation with SOLID principles

**What We Built**:
- Complete folder structure following Clean Architecture layers
- Domain Layer: Entities, Protocols, Use Cases
- Data Layer: Repositories, Data Sources (Local/Remote), DTOs, Mappers  
- Presentation Layer: ViewModels, Publishers
- Feature Modules: Authentication, Synchronization, Schema, Subscription
- Infrastructure: Network, Storage, Logging, Utils
- Dependency Injection container structure
- Comprehensive test architecture
- Package.swift with Supabase dependencies
- README documentation for each module

**Key Deliverables**:
- [x] Sources/SwiftSupabaseSync/ complete folder hierarchy
- [x] Tests/SwiftSupabaseSyncTests/ mirror structure
- [x] Package.swift with dependencies (Supabase Swift, Swift Log)
- [x] .gitignore for Xcode/Swift/iOS/macOS projects
- [x] Module README files explaining each component's purpose
- [x] Basic SwiftSupabaseSync.swift entry point
- [x] Initial test file structure

**Architecture Decisions Made**:
- Clean Architecture with clear layer boundaries
- Feature-based organization for modularity
- Protocol-driven design for testability
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction

#### üîÑ Step 2: Core Domain Layer Implementation
**Status: IN PROGRESS** üöß

**Objective**: Implement the heart of business logic - entities, protocols, and use cases

**Detailed Implementation Plan**:

**‚úÖ 2.1 Domain Entities (Week 1)** - **COMPLETED**
```swift
// Core entities that define our business concepts
‚úÖ User.swift: Authentication state, permissions, subscription status
‚úÖ SyncStatus.swift: Sync state tracking (idle, syncing, error, completed)  
‚úÖ SyncPolicy.swift: Configuration for sync behavior and frequency
‚úÖ SharedTypes.swift: Common enums (SyncFrequency, ConflictResolutionStrategy)
```

**Key Accomplishments**:
- [x] **User Entity**: Complete authentication state, subscription management, feature gating
- [x] **SyncStatus Entity**: Clean sync state tracking with progress monitoring
- [x] **SyncPolicy Entity**: Comprehensive sync configuration with predefined policies
- [x] **SharedTypes**: Consolidated common enums to eliminate duplication
- [x] **Clean Architecture**: Immutable entities with rich business logic
- [x] **Type Safety**: Full Codable, Equatable, Hashable support
- [x] **Compilation**: Package builds successfully with no errors

**2.2 Domain Protocols (Week 1-2)**
```swift
// Core contracts that define system behavior
- Syncable.swift: Protocol for SwiftData models (syncID, lastModified, isDeleted)
- SubscriptionValidating.swift: Pro feature validation interface
- ConflictResolvable.swift: Custom conflict resolution strategies
- SyncRepositoryProtocol.swift: Data access abstraction
```

**2.3 Use Cases (Week 2-3)**
```swift
// Business logic orchestration
- AuthenticateUserUseCase.swift: Login/logout workflows
- StartSyncUseCase.swift: Sync initialization and validation
- ValidateSubscriptionUseCase.swift: Pro feature gate checking
- ResolveSyncConflictUseCase.swift: Conflict resolution orchestration
```

**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Complete domain entities with business rules
- [ ] Protocol definitions with clear contracts
- [ ] Use case implementations with error handling
- [ ] Unit tests achieving 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Documentation with usage examples

**Success Criteria**:
- All domain logic is framework-independent
- Comprehensive test coverage of business rules
- Clear separation between entities and behaviors
- Protocol contracts enable easy mocking

#### üîß Step 3: Infrastructure & Data Sources Setup
**Status: PENDING** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Build the technical foundation for network, storage, and external service integration

**Detailed Implementation Plan**:

**3.1 Network Infrastructure (Week 3-4)**
```swift
// HTTP client and network utilities
- SupabaseClient.swift: Configured HTTP client with auth headers
- NetworkError.swift: Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- RequestBuilder.swift: Type-safe request construction
- NetworkMonitor.swift: Connection state monitoring
```

**3.2 Storage Infrastructure (Week 4)**
```swift
// Local storage abstractions
- KeychainService.swift: Secure credential storage (tokens, keys)
- UserDefaultsService.swift: App preferences and settings
- SwiftDataLocalDataSource.swift: Local model operations
```

**3.3 Remote Data Sources (Week 4-5)**
```swift
// Supabase service integrations
- SupabaseAuthDataSource.swift: Authentication API integration
- SupabaseDataDataSource.swift: Database CRUD operations
- SupabaseRealtimeDataSource.swift: Real-time subscriptions
```

**3.4 Logging & Monitoring (Week 5)**
```swift
// Observability and debugging
- SyncLogger.swift: Structured logging with levels
- PerformanceMonitor.swift: Sync operation metrics
- ErrorTracker.swift: Error categorization and reporting
```

**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Production-ready network layer with error handling
- [ ] Secure local storage implementations
- [ ] Supabase API integrations with proper authentication
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and monitoring system
- [ ] Integration tests for all external services

**Success Criteria**:
- Network layer handles offline scenarios gracefully
- Storage services maintain data security and privacy
- All external integrations have proper error boundaries
- Logging provides actionable debugging information
