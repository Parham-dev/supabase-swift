# Tests

Comprehensive test suite following the same architectural patterns as the main codebase. Tests are organized by layer and feature to ensure complete coverage of business logic, data operations, and integration scenarios.

Includes Core (domain and data layer tests), Features (feature-specific test suites), Infrastructure (service and utility tests), and Mocks (test doubles and fixtures).
